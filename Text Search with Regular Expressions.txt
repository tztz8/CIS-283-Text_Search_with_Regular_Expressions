CIS 283

Text Search Regular Expressions Assignment

 

To turn in:

    Attach a single .RB file as an attachment to the assignment in Canvas

 

To do:

Write a program that will search through a data file using regular expressions.
Your program will ask for which class to search for and it will return the entire line where that class is found.
You must analyze the data file to determine what regular expressions to look for and how to do this for multiple lines.

YOU MAY NOT MODIFY THE ORIGINAL DATA FILE IN ANY WAY.

 

For instance, if you ask the user for the Department abbreviation and the class number like:

Enter Department: CIS

Enter Class Number: 282

 

Your program should print out the line containing “CIS” and “282” as well as the next line following that line like:

 

2007 CIS   282 AN       HD PROG PRN I   5.0 5.0 Hybrid Class 001 1116 F         ARR   ARR

                                                  Jones D     001 1116 MTWTh     10:30A 11:30A   24     15     9 5.0

 

 

The data file is in this folder called Enrollment.txt.

 

Continue to ask the user for Department and Class numbers, printing out the specified lines,
until the user enters “EXIT” for the Department name and then quit.

 

 

Extra Credit 10 points

 

Some classes have 3 or more lines following the main line which contains the department and class number,
so print ALL lines that are associated with that particular class.

 

For instance, the class CIS 146 would return:

 

1953 CIS   146 AN       HD INTRO PROG   5.0 5.0 Affholter T 001 1103 MTWTh     10:30A 11:30A   24     23     1 7.7

           Class is closed, but enrollment has dropped below capacity

                                                          Hybrid Class 001 1103 F         ARR   ARR
